High-level Vulkan wrapper API in C++ to handle low-level details including synchronization.

# motivation

Vulkan is a low-level API designed to support detailed performance tuning. This project abstracts low-level features to enable quick prototyping.

# limitations

* I'd like to support multiple GPU APIs. Specifically, it would be great to support webGPU to deploy applications on the web.
